# Landmark Localization

This repository contains code and configuration files used to perform extraction and matching of landmarks, and localization based on these matches, as presented in [TODO link to my project page, paper].

# Environment

TODO add details of environment setup, opencv requirement

# Notes

If you wish to use the "edge boxes" method for object extraction, you must have a model.yml file defining the learned edge box model.  The publically-available model file used in our experiments can be downloaded here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/blob/master/testdata/cv/ximgproc/model.yml.gz
